### Connor Poli

        I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at Lehigh University. I am minoring inn energy and entrerpernuership, and heavily 
    involved in Lehigh's Baja Sae team. I enjoy spending time outdoors and occasionaly reading when I have the time. I grew up in 
    south east PA 45 minutes north of Philly and have 2 sisters and a dog named Penny. I am interning as a project manager at HT Lyons 
    , a mechanical contractor, this summer. I plan to pursuse a career in either the mechaical contracting sector or heavy machinery. 
    Where ever life takes me I hope to be in a possition of leadwership or mangment in my later life. I decided to take COMM 165 
    because I understand datas importance in todays world and wish to understand much more about it that I do not know.
