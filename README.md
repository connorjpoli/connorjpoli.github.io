## Comm 165 Data Story telling 

### Connor Poli

                I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at Lehigh University. I am minoring in energy and entrepreneurship, and heavily 
        involved in Lehigh's Baja Sae team. I enjoy spending time outdoors and occasionally reading when I have the time. I grew up in 
        southeast PA 45 minutes north of Philly and have 2 sisters and a dog named Penny. I am interning as a project manager at HT Lyons, 
        a mechanical contractor, this summer. I plan to pursue a career in either the mechanical contracting sector or heavy machinery. 
        Wherever life takes me I hope to be in a position of leadership or management in my later life. I decided to take COMM 165 
        because I understand datas importance in today's world and wish to understand much more about it that I do not know.
